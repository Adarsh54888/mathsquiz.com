            <h2>Early Life:</h2>
            <p>
                Albert Einstein was born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm, in the Kingdom of W√ºrttemberg in the German Empire. His parents were Hermann Einstein, a salesman and engineer, and Pauline Koch. Einstein showed an early interest in science and mathematics, although he had a slower start with language skills. <br>
                Despite the educational challenges, Einstein's curiosity and self-study habits flourished. He was deeply influenced by a geometry book he received at the age of 12, which he described as his "sacred little geometry book." At the age of 15, Einstein left school and joined his family in Italy. He later enrolled in the Swiss Federal Polytechnic School in Zurich, where he graduated in 1900.

            <h2>Major Contributions:</h2>
            <p>
                <b>Theory of Special Relativity (1905):</b>

                Einstein introduced the theory of special relativity, fundamentally changing the understanding of space, time, and energy. The famous equation 
                ùê∏
                =
                ùëö
                ùëê
                2
                E=mc 
                2
                  (energy equals mass times the speed of light squared) emerged from this theory, illustrating the relationship between mass and energy.<br>
                <b>Photoelectric Effect (1905):</b>
                
                In a groundbreaking paper, Einstein explained the photoelectric effect, demonstrating that light could be thought of as discrete packets of energy called quanta (later termed photons). This work laid the foundation for quantum theory and earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921.<br>
                <b>Theory of General Relativity (1915):</b>
                
                Einstein extended his theory of relativity to include gravity, proposing that massive objects cause a curvature in space-time, which we perceive as gravity. This theory was confirmed in 1919 during a solar eclipse, when light from stars was observed bending around the sun, as Einstein had predicted.
