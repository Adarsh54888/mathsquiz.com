            <h2>Early Life:</h2>
            <p>
                Archimedes was born in 287 BC in the ancient Greek city of Syracuse on the island of Sicily. He was the son of Phidias, an astronomer, which might have influenced his early interest in science and mathematics. Though much of his early life remains a mystery, it is believed that Archimedes studied in Alexandria, Egypt, which was a major center of learning at the time.

            <h2>Major Contributions:</h2>
            <p>
                <b>Archimedes' Principle:</b> One of his most famous contributions is the principle of buoyancy, which states that a body submerged in a fluid experiences an upward force equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the body. This principle is fundamental in fluid mechanics.<br>
                <b>Calculation of Pi:</b> Archimedes made significant advancements in the approximation of Pi (Ï€). He used a method involving the perimeters of inscribed and circumscribed polygons to approximate Pi more accurately than ever before.<br>
                <b>Area and Volume Calculations:</b> Archimedes developed methods to calculate the area under a curve (leading to the concept of integration) and the volume of various solids, including spheres and cylinders. His work laid the groundwork for calculus, which would be formalized centuries later by Newton and Leibniz.<br>
                <b>Archimedes' Screw: </b>This invention, used to raise water for irrigation and other purposes, consists of a helical screw inside a cylinder. The device is still used in some parts of the world today.<br>
